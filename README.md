Kapitza Pendulum simulation with base oscillating vertically and in arc

There are four files in this folder. The two files named "Vertical Oscillation" and "Arc Osillation" simulate vertical and arc-oscillating base separately. They also graph out valuable information about the two simulations 
such as angle change and mass position. Another file "Lagrange's Equation Verification" verifies the accuracy of the the generalized (arc) oscillation with the known vertical oscillation data. The last file "Experiment Data" uses two variables: starting angle of the base (base_theta) and peak-to-peak angle of the base (theta_pp) to collect data while maintaining these variables as constant: omega: 30Hz, radius: 0.05m, length: 0.05m.
